# Integrating Statistical Significance and Discriminative Power in Pattern Discovery

Description: This repository contains an extension to the δ-Trimax and TriGen triclustering algorithms to be able to jointly incorporate statistical significance, discriminative power criteria, and quality thresholds. We also provide a folder containing the results extracted by the modified versions of δ-Trimax and TriGen from three case studies.
